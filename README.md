# ModelMapper issue

Test case showing how I have trouble mapping an interface to a concrete type using modelmapper's Converter

ModelMapper's implicit mapping is disabled on purpose.

Please note that using an object instantiated by a Spring Data JPA projection seems to work perfectly (use case not in
the tests)
